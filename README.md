# inlets-operator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inlets/inlets-operator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inlets/inlets-operator)

Get a Kubernetes LoadBalancer where you never thought it was possible.

In cloud-based [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) solutions, Services can be exposed as type "LoadBalancer" and your cloud provider will provision a LoadBalancer and start routing traffic, in another word: you get ingress to your service.

inlets-operator brings that same experience to your local Kubernetes or k3s cluster (k3s/k3d/minikube/microk8s/Docker Desktop/KinD). The operator automates the creation of an [inlets](https://inlets.dev) exit-node on public cloud, and runs the client as a Pod inside your cluster. Your Kubernetes `Service` will be updated with the public IP of the exit-node and you can start receiving incoming traffic immediately.

## Who is this for?

This solution is for users who want to gain incoming network access (ingress) to their private Kubernetes clusters running on their laptops, VMs, within a Docker container, on-premises, or behind NAT. The cost of the LoadBalancer with a IaaS like DigitalOcean is around 5 USD / mo, which is 10 USD cheaper than an AWS ELB or GCP LoadBalancer.

Whilst 5 USD is cheaper than a "Cloud Load Balancer", this tool is for users who cannot get incoming connections due to their network configuration, not for saving money vs. public cloud.

## Status and backlog

This version of the inlets-operator is a early proof-of-concept, but it builds upon inlets, which is stable and widely used.

Backlog pending:

- [ ] Automate `wss://` for control-port using self-signed certs or LetsEncrypt and nip.io
- [ ] Move control-port and `/tunnel` endpoint to high port i.e. `31111` and make it configurable in the helm chart
- [ ] Provision to AWS EC2
- [ ] Provision to Civo

Inlets tunnels HTTP traffic at L7, so the inlets-operator can be used to tunnel HTTP traffic. A new project I'm working on called [inlets-pro](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro-pkg) tunnels any TCP traffic at L4 i.e. Mongo, Redis, NATS, SSH, TLS, whatever you like.

## Video demo

This video demo shows a single-node VM running on k3s on Packet.com, and the inlets exit node also being provisioned on Packet's infrastructure.

See an alternative video showing my cluster running with KinD on my Mac and the exit node being provisioned on DigitalOcean:

## Step-by-step tutorial

[Try the step-by-step tutorial](https://blog.alexellis.io/ingress-for-your-local-kubernetes-cluster/)

## Running in-cluster, using DigitalOcean for the exit node

> Note: this example is now multi-arch, so it's valid for `x86_64`, `ARMHF`, and `ARM64`.

You can also run the operator in-cluster, a ClusterRole is used since Services can be created in any namespace, and may need a tunnel.

```sh
# Create a secret to store the access token

kubectl create secret generic inlets-access-key \
  --from-literal inlets-access-key="$(cat ~/Downloads/do-access-token)"

kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/crd.yaml

# Apply the operator deployment and RBAC role
kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/operator-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/operator.yaml
```

## Running in-cluster, using Google Compute Engine for the exit node using helm

> Note: this example is now multi-arch, so it's valid for `x86_64`, `ARMHF`, and `ARM64`.

If you do not have helm installed and configured follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/blob/master/HELM.md)

It is assumed that you have gcloud installed and configured on your machine.
If not, then follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

```sh

# Get current projectID
export PROJECTID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project 2>/dev/null)

# Create a service account
export SERVICEACCOUNT=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list | grep inlets | awk '{print $2}')

# Assign appropriate roles to inlets service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID \
--member serviceAccount:$SERVICEACCOUNT \
--role roles/compute.admin

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID \
--member serviceAccount:$SERVICEACCOUNT \
--role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser

# Create inlets service account key file
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
--iam-account $SERVICEACCOUNT

# Create a secret to store the service account key file
kubectl create secret generic inlets-access-key --from-file=inlets-access-key=key.json

# Add and update the inlets-operator helm repo
helm repo add inlets https://inlets.github.io/inlets-operator/

helm repo update

# Install inlets-operator with the required fields
helm upgrade inlets-operator --install inlets/inlets-operator \
  --set provider=gce,zone=us-central1-a,gceProjectId=$PROJECTID

```
## Running on a Raspberry Pi

Use the same commands as described in the section above.

> There used to be separate deployment files in `artifacts` folder called `operator-amd64.yaml` and `operator-armhf.yaml`.
> Since version `0.2.7` Docker images get built for multiple architectures with the same tag which means that there is now just one deployment file called `operator.yaml` that can be used on all supported architecures.

## Get a LoadBalancer provided by inlets

```sh
kubectl run nginx-1 --image=nginx --port=80 --restart=Always
kubectl run nginx-2 --image=nginx --port=80 --restart=Always

kubectl expose deployment nginx-1 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
kubectl expose deployment nginx-2 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer

kubectl get svc

kubectl get tunnel/nginx-1-tunnel -o yaml

kubectl logs deploy/nginx-1-tunnel-client
```

Check the IP of the LoadBalancer and then access it via the Internet.

Example with OpenFaaS, make sure you give the `port` a `name` of `http`, otherwise a default of `80` will be used incorrectly.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gateway
  namespace: openfaas
  labels:
    app: gateway
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 31112
  selector:
    app: gateway
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## Annotations

By default the operator will create a tunnel for every loadbalancer service.

To ignore a service such as `traefik` type in: `kubectl annotate svc/traefik -n kube-system dev.inlets.manage=false`

You can also set the operator to ignore the services by default and only manage them when the annotation is true. `dev.inlets.manage=true`
To do this, run the operator with the flag `-annotated-only`

## Monitor/view logs

The operator deployment is in the `kube-system` namespace.

```sh
kubectl logs deploy/inlets-operator -n kube-system -f
```
