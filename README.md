"Get a Kubernetes LoadBalancer where you never thought it was possible."

In cloud-based [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) solutions, Services can be exposed as type "LoadBalancer" and your cloud provider will provision a LoadBalancer and start routing traffic, in another word: you get ingress to your service.

inlets-operator brings that same experience to your local Kubernetes or k3s cluster (k3s/k3d/minikube/microk8s/Docker Desktop/KinD). The operator automates the creation of an [inlets](https://inlets.dev) exit-node on public cloud, and runs the client as a Pod inside your cluster. Your Kubernetes `Service` will be updated with the public IP of the exit-node and you can start receiving incoming traffic immediately.

## Who is this for?

This solution is for users who want to gain incoming network access (ingress) to their private Kubernetes clusters running on their laptops, VMs, within a Docker container, on-premises, or behind NAT. The cost of the LoadBalancer with a IaaS like DigitalOcean is around 5 USD / mo, which is 10 USD cheaper than an AWS ELB or GCP LoadBalancer.

Whilst 5 USD is cheaper than a "Cloud Load Balancer", this tool is for users who cannot get incoming connections due to their network configuration, not for saving money vs. public cloud.

You can configure the operator to use either of our tunnels: inlets OSS for L7 HTTP traffic, or inlets PRO which adds L4 TCP support, automatic encryption with TLS and can enable the use of an IngressController and cert-manager directly from your laptop or private cloud.

## Status and backlog

The inlets-operator automates cloud host provisioning to run inlets or inlets-pro to expose internal services to the Internet.

There are two tunnel projects available for you to use with the inlets-operator:

* [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets)

  Tunnel L7 HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
  Free, OSS, built for community developers. Encryption via TLS to be configured separately.

* [inlets-pro](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro)

  Tunnel any TCP traffic at L4 i.e. Mongo, Postgres, MariaDB, Redis, NATS, SSH and TLS itself.
  Automatic end-to-end encryption built-in with TLS.
  Tunnel an IngressController including TLS termination.
  Commercially licensed and supported. For cloud native operators and developers.

Operator cloud host provisioning:

- [x] Provision VMs/exit-nodes on public cloud
  - [x] Provision to [Packet.com](https://packet.com)
  - [x] Provision to DigitalOcean
  - [x] Provision to Scaleway
  - [x] Provision to GCP
  - [x] Provision to AWS EC2
- [x] Publish stand-alone [Go provisioning library/SDK](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl/tree/master/pkg/provision)

With [`inlets-pro`](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro) configured, you get the following additional benefits:

- [x] Automatic configuration of TLS and encryption using secured websocket `wss://` for control-port
- [x] Tunnel pure TCP traffic
- [x] Separate data-plane (ports given by Kubernetes) and control-plane (port `8132`)

Other features:

- [x] Automatically update Service type LoadBalancer with a public IP
- [x] Tunnel L7 `http` traffic
- [x] In-cluster Role, Dockerfile and YAML files
- [x] Raspberry Pi / armhf build and YAML file
- [x] ARM64 (Graviton/Odroid/Packet.com) Dockerfile/build and K8s YAML files
- [x] Ignore Services with `dev.inlets.manage: false` annotation
- [x] Garbage collect hosts when Service or CRD is deleted
- [x] CI with Travis and automated release artifacts
- [x] One-line installer [k3sup](https://k3sup.dev/) - `k3sup app install inlets-operator --help`

Backlog pending:
- [ ] Provision to Civo

## Step-by-step tutorial

[Try the step-by-step tutorial](https://blog.alexellis.io/ingress-for-your-local-kubernetes-cluster/)

## Running in-cluster, using DigitalOcean for the exit node

> Note: this example is now multi-arch, so it's valid for `x86_64`, `ARMHF`, and `ARM64`.

You can also run the operator in-cluster, a ClusterRole is used since Services can be created in any namespace, and may need a tunnel.

```sh
# Create a secret to store the access token

kubectl create secret generic inlets-access-key \
  --from-literal inlets-access-key="$(cat ~/Downloads/do-access-token)"

kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/crd.yaml

# Apply the operator deployment and RBAC role
kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/operator-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/operator.yaml
```

You can also install the inlets-operator using a single command using [k3sup](https://k3sup.dev/), k3sup runs against any valid Kubernetes cluster and is not limited to use with k3s.

Install with inlets PRO:

```sh
k3sup app install inlets-operator \
 --provider digitalocean \
 --region lon1 \
 --token-file $HOME/Downloads/do-access-token \
 --license $(cat $HOME/inlets-pro-license.txt)
```

Install with inlets OSS:

```sh
k3sup app install inlets-operator \
 --provider digitalocean \
 --region lon1 \
 --token-file $HOME/Downloads/do-access-token
```

## Using a provider which requires an Access Key and Secret Key? (AWS EC2, Scaleway)

These providers require an additional secret to be provided, this can be created like this:


 
To install using `k3sup` you can pass the additional --secret-key-file arg

```sh

k3sup app install inlets-operator \
 --provider ec2 \
 --region eu-west-1 \
 --token-file $HOME/Downloads/access-key \
 --secret-key-file $HOME/Downloads/secret-access-key \
 --license $(cat $HOME/inlets-pro-license.txt)

```

If you are installing manually, using the yaml files you will need to un-comment the sections indicated in the
 `artifacts/operator.yaml` file

```sh

kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/crd.yaml

# Create a secret to store the access token

kubectl create secret generic inlets-access-key \
  --from-literal inlets-access-key="$(cat ~/Downloads/access-key)"

# Create a secret to store the secret access token

kubectl create secret generic inlets-secret-key \
  --from-literal inlets-secret-key="$(cat ~/Downloads/secret-access-key)"

kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/crd.yaml

# Apply the operator deployment and RBAC role
kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/operator-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./artifacts/operator.yaml
```
 

## Running in-cluster, using Google Compute Engine for the exit node using helm

> Note: this example is now multi-arch, so it's valid for `x86_64`, `ARMHF`, and `ARM64`.

If you do not have helm installed and configured follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/blob/master/HELM.md)

It is assumed that you have gcloud installed and configured on your machine.
If not, then follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

```sh
# Get current projectID
export PROJECTID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project 2>/dev/null)

# Create a service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create inlets \
--description "inlets-operator service account" \
--display-name "inlets"

# Get service account email
export SERVICEACCOUNT=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list | grep inlets | awk '{print $2}')

# Assign appropriate roles to inlets service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID \
--member serviceAccount:$SERVICEACCOUNT \
--role roles/compute.admin

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID \
--member serviceAccount:$SERVICEACCOUNT \
--role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser

# Create inlets service account key file
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
--iam-account $SERVICEACCOUNT

# Create a secret to store the service account key file
kubectl create secret generic inlets-access-key --from-file=inlets-access-key=key.json

# Add and update the inlets-operator helm repo
helm repo add inlets https://inlets.github.io/inlets-operator/

helm repo update

# Install inlets-operator with the required fields
helm upgrade inlets-operator --install inlets/inlets-operator \
  --set provider=gce,zone=us-central1-a,projectID=$PROJECTID

```

## Get a LoadBalancer provided by inlets

```sh
kubectl run nginx-1 --image=nginx --port=80 --restart=Always
kubectl run nginx-2 --image=nginx --port=80 --restart=Always

kubectl expose deployment nginx-1 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
kubectl expose deployment nginx-2 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer

kubectl get svc

kubectl get tunnel/nginx-1-tunnel -o yaml

kubectl logs deploy/nginx-1-tunnel-client
```

Check the IP of the LoadBalancer and then access it via the Internet.

## Get an IngressController plus TLS termination

You can bring your own IngressController if you are using inlets-pro, learn more with this tutorial:

* [Expose Your IngressController and get TLS from LetsEncrypt](https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-ingresscontroller-cert-manager?id=expose-your-ingresscontroller-and-get-tls-from-letsencrypt)

## Notes on OSS inlets

inlets PRO can tunnel multiple ports, but inlets OSS is set to take the first port named "http" for your service. With the OSS version of inlets (see example with OpenFaaS), make sure you give the `port` a `name` of `http`, otherwise a default of `80` will be used incorrectly.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gateway
  namespace: openfaas
  labels:
    app: gateway
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 31112
  selector:
    app: gateway
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## Annotations and ignoring services

By default the operator will create a tunnel for every LoadBalancer service.

To ignore a service such as `traefik` type in: `kubectl annotate svc/traefik -n kube-system dev.inlets.manage=false`

You can also set the operator to ignore the services by default and only manage them when the annotation is true. `dev.inlets.manage=true`
To do this, run the operator with the flag `-annotated-only`

## Monitor/view logs

The operator deployment is in the `kube-system` namespace.

```sh
kubectl logs deploy/inlets-operator -n kube-system -f
```

## Running on a Raspberry Pi

Use the same commands as described in the section above.

> There used to be separate deployment files in `artifacts` folder called `operator-amd64.yaml` and `operator-armhf.yaml`.
> Since version `0.2.7` Docker images get built for multiple architectures with the same tag which means that there is now just one deployment file called `operator.yaml` that can be used on all supported architecures.

# Provider Pricing

The host [provisioning code](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl/tree/master/pkg/provision) used by the inlets-operator is shared with [inletsctl](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl), both tools use the configuration in the grid below.

These costs need to be treated as an estimate and will depend on your bandwidth usage and how many hosts you decide to create. You can at all times check your cloud provider's dashboard, API, or CLI to view your exit-nodes. The hosts provided have been chosen because they are the absolute lowest-cost option that the maintainers could find.
